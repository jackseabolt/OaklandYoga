			<p>John Smith is a graduate of the Yoga College of India and trained personally with Bikram Choudhury. John holds degrees in English literature from UC Santa Cruz and Biology at UC Irvine. Four years ago, John was helping to work towards a vaccine for Alzheimers disease and preparing for a single-handed sailboat race to Hawaii, when he suffered an injury to his lower spine. Faced with a doctor's recommendation of surgery, he began to practice at the Yoga College of India in San Francisco. Within one month, John's symptoms were greatly alleviated. Within four months, they were all but gone.
			<br /><br />
			Since then, John has immersed himself in Bikram's yoga and has experienced a transformation in body and spirit. Since he started practicing this method, John has lost 30 lbs and his remarkable recovery has inspired him to travel to India and other places around the world seeking a deeper knowledge of the practice and philosophy of Yoga.
			<br /><br />
			In 2001, John became a certified teacher of the Bikram method and has, since, been teaching regularly. His precise, rhythmic teaching style has been well received by students at schools throughout the Bay Area.
